### Project Title
Exploring The U.S. Bikeshare Data :+1: :sparkles:


### Description
In this project, I use Python (version 3.8) to explore exciting information about bike-share data in the U.S. in three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington by writing code in Python to extract all the information that we need.

We have extracted much interesting information about:

first: Popular times of travel which includes most common month, day of week, and hour of day.

Second: popular stations and trip which includes most common start station, end station, and most common trip from start to end.

Third: Trip duration which includes total travel time and average travel time.

Forth and lastly: User info, which includes counts of each gender, counts of each gender, and earliest, most recent, most common year of birth.


### Files used
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.
